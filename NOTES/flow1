1. **Home Component Mounts:**
   - The `useEffect` hook in the `Home` component triggers the `gettingProfiles()` function when the component mounts.

2. **Action Dispatch:**
   - The `gettingProfiles()` function creates an action of type `SET_ALL_PROFILES_START` (defined in `action.ts`) and dispatches it.

3. **Saga Intercepts the Action:**
   - The `profileSaga` (defined in `profileSaga.ts`) listens for the `SET_ALL_PROFILES_START` action using `takeEvery`. When this action is detected, it calls the `getProfilesAPI` generator function.

4. **API Fetch:**
   - Inside the `getProfilesAPI` function:
     - A `fetch` request is made to the API endpoint.
     - The response is converted to JSON.
     - An action of type `SET_ALL_PROFILES` is dispatched, carrying the fetched data.

5. **Reducer Updates State:**
   - The reducer (defined in `reducer.ts`) processes the `SET_ALL_PROFILES` action.
     - It updates the Redux state by storing the fetched profiles in the `profiles` array.
     - It sets `loading` to `false`.

6. **UI Re-renders:**
   - The `Home` component retrieves the updated `profiles` and `loading` state using `useSelector`.
   - Since `loading` is `false`, the component renders the fetched profiles.
